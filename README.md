# DotnetCore-Api-GoogleAuth
Baking a repository that could be a template to start and test new things

Currently I just uploaded an angular app, but I will also add Vue and React.

## Dependencies
You should have dotnet core 3.0+ installed to run the backend
You should also have node and npm installed (node 10+ because of angular6)

## Starting the application

first, change appsettings.json to include your google ClientId and ClientSecret

on backend:  
src/DotnetApi/ 
dotnet run

on frontend: 
src/Client/Angular 
npm install
npm run serve
